## 1. Sequence Basics üìä

### Understanding Sequences
A sequence is a list of numbers in order. Think of it as:
- Pattern of values following a rule
- Function with domain of natural numbers
- Stepping stones to series
- Ordered list of terms

### Basic Concepts
#### Notation
- {a‚Çô} represents a sequence
- a‚Çô is the nth term
- Explicit vs. recursive form
- Index notation

#### Example Walkthrough
Find the first 4 terms of a‚Çô = n¬≤/(n+1)
1. **n = 1**:
   - a‚ÇÅ = 1¬≤/(1+1) = 1/2
2. **n = 2**:
   - a‚ÇÇ = 2¬≤/(2+1) = 4/3
3. **n = 3**:
   - a‚ÇÉ = 9/4
4. **n = 4**:
   - a‚ÇÑ = 16/5

### Convergence of Sequences
#### Process for Finding Limits
1. **Identify Pattern**:
   - Look for trend
   - Consider behavior as n grows
   - Watch for special forms
   - Consider asymptotes

2. **Calculate Limit**:
   - Use limit techniques
   - Consider infinity rules
   - Watch for indeterminate forms
   - Verify conclusion

#### Example Walkthrough
Find $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n+1}{n}$
1. **Analyze form**:
   - Divide numerator and denominator by n
2. **Simplify**:
   - $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{n})$
3. **Evaluate**:
   - As n ‚Üí ‚àû, 1/n ‚Üí 0
   - Limit = 1

### Common Mistakes
1. **Notation Errors**:
   - Confusing n and k
   - Missing subscripts
   - Wrong index bounds
   - Incorrect brackets/parentheses

2. **Conceptual Errors**:
   - Confusing sequence vs. series
   - Wrong starting index
   - Missing terms
   - Pattern recognition

## 2. Series Tests üîç

### Understanding Series
A series is the sum of sequence terms. Think of it as:
- Adding up infinite terms
- Accumulation of sequence values
- Limit of partial sums
- Infinite summation

### Test Selection Guide
| Test | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| n-th Term | First check |
| Geometric | Constant ratio |
| p-Series | $\frac{1}{n^p}$ form |
| Integral | Decreasing, positive |
| Comparison | Compare to known |
| Ratio | Fraction of terms |
| Root | nth root |
| Alternating | (-1)‚Åø series |

### Detailed Tests
#### 1. n-th Term Test
- If $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0$, series diverges
- Necessary but not sufficient
- Quick first check
- Can't prove convergence
